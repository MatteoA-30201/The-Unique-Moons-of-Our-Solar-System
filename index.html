      <p> When someone thinks of our solar system, they usually think of the sun, and the 8 planets that orbit it. They may not think about interesting and unique moons that orbit the planets as well. Not only are there many moons in our solar system, sometimes these moons could be even more interesting than the planets that they orbit. Some moons like <strong>Enceladus</strong> or <strong>Europa</strong> have <em>vast oceans under the planets surface</em>, which could very well hold <em>aquatic marine life</em>. While others like <strong>Titan</strong> have <em>methane lakes</em> that could possibly hold life and an atmosphere which is <em>50% more dense than Earth's atmosphere</em>. In this website I will compile lots if information on interesting moons such as the ones I have listed in this paragraph to show how amazing our solar system and it's moons are.</p>
